## The Backstory 
Our team sought out a challenge, upon completing our MERN stack. With this desire we decided to collaborate together and sought to quell it side-by-side, in true adventures fashion. 

This bring us here, to Slash/Bud. We set out to create a Steam clone, and with no desire to re-invent the wheel, drew a lot of our design choices off of the already established platform.

Armed with the knowledge and tools gained from our MERN stack, we began to build and learn new things along the way. The crumbly <sup>cookies of</sup> <sub> JWT</sub>, the **_ever-changing direction of Tailwind_**, and the *ethereal wisps of AWS*. Lastly the two pillars of our application, **IGDB API to the West**, and **CheapShark API to the East**. 

All of these posed as daunting challenges to overcome, yet our bold company **never wavered** and delivered to you now: 


> *__A clickable prototype with CRUD functionality__*

> * Register an Account and Log-in
> * Create Lists, either for public display or personal, perhaps even a _favorite_
> * Search for characters and games, your favorites or soon to be hated villains
> * Find the latest sales and deals available to you
> * Save those you deem worthy to your ever-growing collection of lists


There is always more work to be done, edges of CSS to sharpen, bugs to stamp out, new routes to establish. Which our enbattled crew may take, or perhaps a shadowy group of ninjas from The Dojo will continue this true and honest work.
